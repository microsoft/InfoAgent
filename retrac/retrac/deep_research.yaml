  Below is the summary from the previous attempt:
  {last_summary}
  1. Critical Evaluation:
    The summary provided above is a *suggested* synthesis of past efforts, not an absolute truth. It may contain hallucinations, unverified assumptions, or premature conclusions. You are encouraged to:
    - Identify and ignore any parts of the summary that seem illogical or poorly supported.
    - If the summary's quality is low or its direction feels like a dead-end, you have the full autonomy to completely disregard it and initiate a fresh search strategy.
  2. Expand the search space:
    If the task remains unsolved, it means the current search space is insufficient. Do not get trapped in the "logic loop" of the summary. Use the [Uncertainties, Limitations, Gaps] section as a springboard to:
    - Pivot to entirely different keyword clusters or tool-call strategies.
    - Cross-verify "Facts" that were marked as "unverified" or "partial" in the summary.
  3. Autonomous re-planning:
    The summary provides the *memory*, but you provide the *reasoning*. Based on the existing facts and your own judgment of the current situation, determine your own next steps.
  Now continue your deep search task. You have full permission to be skeptical of the past and bold in your current exploration.

  CRITICAL OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)
  You MUST follow the exact format below. Do NOT add extra sections, headers, prefaces, or commentary.
  Do NOT use placeholders like “see above”, “as mentioned”, “ibid.”, “refer to earlier”, or “same as before”.
  Do NOT omit any important information that appears in the input.

  OUTPUT FORMAT (EXACT)
  You must directly record the actual information content in plain text (not just summaries). Include:
  0) Current Answer
    - Provide the single best, most definite answer identified so far based on conclusive evidence. If no final answer is certain, state "None".
  1) Facts & Evidence Collected
    - List every factual item discovered. Attach a source annotation: [Source: <tool/doc> | <URL/id> | Verified: yes/no/partial].
  2) Analysis & Conclusions
    - State all logical conclusions derived, explicitly linking each to the supporting evidence IDs from section (1).
  3) Source Inventory & Verification Status
    - Enumerate all visited sources and evaluate their current verification status.
  4) Uncertainties, Limitations, Gaps
    - List all unknown variables, data ambiguities, and failure modes currently blocking a final decision.

  QUALITY RULES
  - Be exhaustive over the input: no omissions.
  - Keep claims tightly tied to evidence; if you infer, label it “Inference” and explain why.
  - If sources conflict, present both and state which you trust more (and why).
